## FAQ what_is_manga
* ask_faq/what_is_manga
    - Manga refers to graphic novels from Japan. The word’s meaning, literally, is “illustrated thing,” and the medium has historical roots in the woodblock printing industry and urban culture, starting in the 1600s. With a complicated writing system, woodblock printing produced art prints and broadsheets for the highly literate townsfolk. Since everything would be carved into blocks anyway, it was as easy to illustrate something as it was to write text for it. Like many other Japanese words, manga can be either singular or plural. As with other Japanese books, and to preserve the flow of the artwork, a manga is read from right to left and from top to bottom. When you look at the front cover, the spine is on the right.

* ask_faq/manga_diff_graphic_novels
    -Rather than our glossy and colorful magazine format, manga are generally in black and white, and in a thicker, trade-paperback-like size. The books we get are usually several collected chapters that originally ran separately in popular Japanese magazines like Shonen Jump. Aside from this, there’s a greater range of themes for the mainstream market. Manga can be about anything from fantasy cloak-and-dagger politics, to high school comedies. Aside from the genres available, manga tend to be produced in a serial format, rather than as stand-alone art house types of graphic novels, or endless-run comic books. Some mangaka (manga authors) get famous enough to call the shots, even to the point of publishing at their own pace.
